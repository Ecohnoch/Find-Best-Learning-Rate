# Find-Best-Learning-Rate

This repo aims to find the best learning rate for my deep learning research.

### Face Recognition

Src Repo: [https://github.com/Ecohnoch/Tiny-Face-Recognition](https://github.com/Ecohnoch/Tiny-Face-Recognition)

Set lr schedule:

![lr_schedule](https://github.com/Ecohnoch/Find-Best-Learning-Rate/blob/master/Face_Recognition/lr_schedule.jpg)

Loss changes:

![output](https://github.com/Ecohnoch/Find-Best-Learning-Rate/blob/master/Face_Recognition/output.jpg)

So we can find 1e-4 is the best original learning rate for my face recognition.

To be continued.
